# 0x01. ES6 Promises

## Overview

Welcome to the "0x01. ES6 Promises" repository. In this project, we explore the fundamentals of ES6 Promises and asynchronous JavaScript programming. This serves as a valuable resource, especially for junior developers aiming to master asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Working with Promises:**
   - Understand the basics of Promises.
   - Learn to create, resolve, and reject Promises.

2. **Handling Errors in Promises:**
   - Explore techniques for handling errors in Promises.

3. **Async/Await Syntax:**
   - Delve into the mechanics of async functions and learn how to use await.

4. **Parallel and Sequential Execution with Promise.all and Promise.allSettled:**
   - Execute multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently with `Promise.all`.
   - Utilize `Promise.allSettled` for handling each Promise independently.

5. **Error Handling in Async/Await:**
   - Master error handling in async functions.

6. **Working with Asynchronous Functions:**
   - Implement and understand the use of asynchronous functions.

7. **Utilizing Promise.race:**
   - Explore advanced Promise usage with `Promise.race`.

8. **Real-world Examples:**
   - Apply your knowledge to real-world examples involving web API interactions.

9. **Introduction to ESLint and Jest:**
   - Understand the importance of linting and testing asynchronous code with ESLint and Jest.

10. **Combining Multiple Asynchronous Operations:**
    - Learn to coordinate and combine multiple asynchronous operations.
